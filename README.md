# Object-Detection-with-Faster-RCNN-Pytorch-Implementation

This is a pytorch implementation of Faster RCNN in the context of object detection from scratch. Majority of the modules, such as Anchor Generation and Proposal filterings, are inspired by and rebuilt from official or efficient implementations. This repository serves primarily as my method to learn the underlying theory of Faster RCNN through ground-up code production. 

As I'm a high school senior currently, I can not guarantee that the code is properly formmatted, written, or annotated (though I am trying my best). If you have any feedback on how any particular parts of the code repository could be written more efficiently, feel free to contact me or leave a notice. The goal of this repository is to help me build a better understanding of object detection while learning to write better "production" worthy code so all feedback, however worded, is appreciated.
